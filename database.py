"""
Lightweight SQLite database utilities for the AI Booking Assistant.

This module:
- Connects to the SQLite database
- Initializes required tables
- Exposes helper functions to insert customers and bookings
- Provides a convenience function to fetch all bookings (for the admin dashboard)

No ORM is used; all queries are written in plain SQL.
